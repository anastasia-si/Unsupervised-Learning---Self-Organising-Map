# Unsupervised-Learning---Self-Organising-Map

Use SOM to detect outliers (interpreting them as probable fraud customers)
Then use ANN to confirm our guesses from the SOM and train it so that we have a classification model to classify the frauds instead of an unsupervised model that is hard to predict on. 

The ANN trains on the data so that we now have a classifcation model and makes the classification process for the new incoming customers really fast and easy
