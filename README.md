# Unsupervised-Learning---Self-Organising-Map

1. Use Self-Organising-Map to detect outliers. Though SOM only shows that some customers are different from other customers, after some investigation we could interpret outliers as probable fraud customers. The aim of SOM is to represent data in a more organized structure and reveal some similarity between datapoints.

2. Then use ANN to confirm our guesses from the SOM and train it so that we have a classification model to classify the frauds instead of an unsupervised model that is hard to predict on. 

The ANN trains on the data so that we now have a classifcation model and makes the classification process for the new incoming customers really fast and easy
